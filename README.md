# Challenge-3-Password-Generator

## Introduction
This is a Password Generator! The website allows for users to have a random and secure password generated
for them. The user simply answers a few prompts that about what they want their password to include and Voila-- You've 
got a secure password!

## My Assignment
My assignment was to create a functional password generator. The website asks the user 5 prompts that have to
do with the details of the password to be generated. Details such as character length, special characters, numeric characters 
and upper/lower case characters can be chosen by the user.
